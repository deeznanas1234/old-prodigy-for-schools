# Old Prodigy

This is some pretty simple modding of older versions of Prodigy, to get them to work right now, in the present day!
If you want a little dose of nostalgia from older Prodigy versions, no matter what the purpose - 
seeing the older battle systems, the older quests, or anything of the sort - 
then you know where you are, and you know what to do!

There are a lot of versions to choose from based on your preferences, covering YEARS worth of updates from Prodigy's team!

I am still actively working on bettering it, so if you have any problems with bugs, glitches, etc. Just make an issue
and I'll try to address it as soon as I can!

There are also forks of my mods. Check them out whenever you get the chance! They're awesome!

## How to play

Playing this couldn't be more simple. First thing you have to do is open the site, which is automatically updated from this
repository!

To do so, you just click on any link here: https://ao28th28.github.io/oldprodigy or https://ao28th28.github.io/oldprodigy/select

Once you're there, you can select a version to play. There are LOTS of versions to choose from, so try not to be overwhelmed
by the number of choices, and there are still more versions and updates to come!

Once you've selected a version, it'll take you to the login screen where you have 3 options. To create a new wizard, to start in offline mode,
or to load a previous save.

If you want to start a quick game and not configure how your character appears, you should choose offline mode, but in Spring 2015 versions, you have to click on the new wizard button and then the generate random button.

If you want to start a new game and configure your character however you want, you should choose to create a new character.

If you want to load a character that you've already saved, you click load character and select your save file.

To save your character, you can just go into the settings menu, go under 'network' and click the button called "save character". It'll automatically download
to your computer, For this I recommend manually choosing a folder to save it in so you can organize it as you need. If there is no network tab in the version
you're playing in, click the 'other' tab instead.

## List of Versions!

List of version choices:

- 1.0.0 | Coming Soon!

  No house, skywatch or the dark tower found in this version!

- 1.2.0 | Coming Soon!

  This doesn't even have the Dark Tower.

- 1.3.1 | Coming Soon!

  This might be the last version without the house.

- 1.5.0 | Coming Soon!

  This was the last version to have the Leaderboards available and to name the Barnacle Cove, 'Pirate Isle'.

- 1.6.0 | Coming Soon!

  This has the 1-11-0's quests thing. The leaderboards can't be viewed yet. Pirate Isle's name is Barnacle Cove.

- 1.7.0 | TBA!

  (Need to add)

- 1.8.0 | TBA!

  (Need to add)

- 1.8.9 | Early 2015 Beta Testing!

  This was supposed to be in early 2015.

- 1.9.0 | March 2015

  This version is really special, because it's the oldest one on this site! This version features a tutorial that is different from all of these versions! You start off in the Academy, but then it falls under attack! You help defend the academy by battling off some of the monsters that are attacking the Academy! The wizard maker is also different here! You also setup which pet you start with in battle just before the battle starts, rather than in the pet menu.

- 1.10.0 | March 2015

  This was exactly the same as 1.9.0. This is also the oldest version that has been preserved via the Internet Archive.

- 1.11.0 | April 2015

  This is the first version with Clockwork Town.

- 1.12.2 | The older version that can run essentially flawlessly.

  Now don't get me wrong, this isn't the oldest version of Prodigy ever, but it's pretty old! Lots of old elements around that aren't seen in newer versions.
  
- 1.16.5 | The older version with all of the legacy quests, and the element selection.

  This is a version that I recommend in particular, it's kind of like 1.11.0 - but it's generally a lot more stable. In fact this version
  is one of the most stable Prodigy versions on this site!

- 1.16.6 | The same as 1.16.5!

  TBA

- 1.17.0 | The older version with tileset-style maps!

  This version was the first to introduce an old tutorial from 9/8/2015, more in-depth than 1.16.5 and before, which would end up being used all the way up to 1.30.0!
  Not only did this version have that, but it also introduced the precursor to the modern firefly forest (before they updated the tileset and updated Flora's sprite).

- 1.17.5 | 1-17-0!

  This is the same as in 1-17-0!
  
- 1.18.0 | All Hallow's Eve!

  This version is really neat because it has the first Pumpkinfest! This means Halloween decorations are all around the map, and there's a Pumpkinfest shop, with all-kinds
  of exclusive, creepy items and gear you can buy with your gold! Other than that it's pretty much just like 1.17.0.

- 1.18.2 | 1.18.0!

  This is the same as 1.18.0.

- 1.20.1 | New Shiverchill Mountains! Coming Soon!

  Shiverchill Mountains now has the walking quests. 

- 1.24.0 | A whole lot of stuff added in!

  This version introduced a new tile-based Lamplight town, and a LOT of new menu designs added in. There's a problem going from Barnacle Cove to Lamplight Town without actually using the map.
  Pretty safe to say a LOT happened between 1.20.1, and this version.

- 1.25.3 | Big Hex now exists! Coming Soon!

  You can now adopt Big Hex by using settings (the options menu) and another way to adopt Big Hex was in 2016 and it's no longer doable. The portal is now on the 2014-2016's map.

- 1.29.0 | Just as many radical changes!

  This version had the updated Skywatch, the updated Bonfire Spire, AND an updated map screen! This version also introduced achievements and all kinds of
  other, more subtle changes. This version is another one that I really recommend trying out, another definitive update.

- 1.30.0 | Same as 1.29.0!

  TBA  

- 1.35.2 | New Lamplight Town, new tutorial and Pumpkinfest!?
  
  This version had a brand-new tutorial, which is the base for the MODERN DAY Prodigy tutorial, even though it's been changed in multiple ways, the resemblance is
  uncanny! This also brought in the modern-style Lamplight Town, now some things are arranged differently, but it's still essentially the same. 
  Happy Halloween, plus the toolbar has gotten a new design. The pet buddy shop is still currently closed. The icons on the bar are also redesigned.

- 1.37.0 | Winterfest!?

  This version has Winterfest, which is pretty cool if you're interested in that. You can now buy pet buddies from the pet buddy shop. The Daily Login Bonus is also available. You don't have to complete Firefly Forest first to go to any zone. Going from Firefly Forest to Shiverchill Mountains, Shiverchill Mountains to Skywatch, Skywatch to Bonfire Spire, Bonfire Spire to Barnacle Cove, Bonfire Spire to Skywatch, Skywatch to Shiverchill Mountains, and Shiverchill Mountains to Firefly Forest without actually using the map is now impossible.

- 1.39.0 | Crazy battle update!?

  This version introduced a refresh on the battle system, with a new health meter not using hearts, but a health bar! It also shows how much damage is dealt in
  each attack, and introduces critical hits. This also has leveling up mid-battle and some new animations to accompany this! This version also has the Firefly Forest reskin,
  which looks really cool!

- 1.46.2 | Potions and Epic Attacks!?

  This version added not only Potions, but was also the first to have Epic Attacks! The tutorial route was also re-worked a bit. Rather than going through the heart of
  Lamplight town, this version just passes through the shop district, and is overall a less drawn-out tutorial.

- 1.50.0 | Lots of significant changes added in!

  This version has a lot of significant changes, For starters EPIC ATTACKS are added now, along with some new battle sound effects! The tutorial route was also re-worked
  a bit, and now it uses a shorter route that doesn't take you through Lamplight Square and is overall less drawn-out. This is yet another version I truly recommend,
  in my opinion, it is one of the definitive Prodigy versions.

- 1.51.0 | NEW AVATAR!? EW!

  This update has always been a bit controversial... The avatar was completely reworked in this version, and instead of using sprite sheets, it used atlases. This means
  that the animations could be a LOT smoother than before! However, it just plain didn't have the same amount of detail that the previous avatar had.
  The loading system also got a bit of internal reworking in this update, meaning that some icons would have some loading issues, which is the main reason I
  recommend 1.50.0 over this update.

- 1.52.0 | TBA

  TBA

- 1.60.0 | ARGH! OUR SHIP IS SINKING MATEYS! I THINK WE MIGHT WRECK!

  Ahem - anyway, this update was one of the first with the Starlight Festival! This update also introduced the new in-game chat, although it's not a big deal anyway since
  this is in offline mode... Ooh! Also, this brought in Shipwreck Shore, replacing Barnacle Cove! This also has Pippet Battles!

- 1.70.0 | Huh I can dab now? Cool

  This update added in some quest progress popups for when you enter the following areas: Firefly Forest, Shiverchill Mountain, Skywatch, Bonfire Spire, and Shipwreck Shore.
  Pretty nifty, but is there anything significant- Also the Dark Tower got completely redesigned with a tileset model- COUNT ME IN!
  Oh and aside from all that stuff, you can dab now. Does that mean it's coming back- Also there's Winterfest, and 4 new epics are added in now. Pretty nifty.

- 1.80.0 | A battle overhaul!?

  Wow, that was quick- Huh. Ok - Anyway, the battle got changed a bit so that instead of having up to 4 pets, you only have up to 2. HOWEVER
  They are all on screen at the same time and the battle background uses tilesets now.

- 1.90.0 | Bunnies Vs. Foxes!

  The leaderboards got overhauled a bit and overall look way brighter than before. Also, the Dyno Dig Oasis quests are phased out now, Professor Scoog is now a shopkeeper.
  This version also includes some general stability improvements, and the first Springfest in Prodigy was also here. Also a lot of new music was added in!

- 2.0.0 | Coming Soon!

  Coming Soon!

- 2.6.0 | Another battle overhaul!

  What? Again? That was quick- Ah don't worry about it, that'll be the last major revision for the next 4 and a half years! Whew, thank goodness. Anyway, this marks a point
  where a lot of previously bitmap-based fonts start to get replaced by vector fonts. There are also a lot of more obscure and internal changes but who cares about that, the battle revision is the focus here. Anyway to go into more detail about the battle revision, basically everything has a LOT of health now, attacks do more damage, higher leveled players/pets are way more powerful, and relics and wands have spells associated with them rather than choosing them in a spellbook. The older spells also were completely phased out in favor of newer spells with smoother animation, but that's the gist.

- 2.20.0 | Getting some gale force winds here guys!

  This update has the academy! You'll be able to go into the archives, meet Gale, and do all sorts of stuff there. There is also a lot of GUI changes here. The character
  name now uses a vector font now. The settings menu also got a glow-up! Also, this version happens to be really stable. Like REALLY stable. I definitely recommend giving
  it a shot!

- 2.30.0 | New Nicknames!

  This update has new nicknames and Winterfest! The nicknamer thing also got redesigned.

- 2.45.0 | The Earth Tower!

  The Earth Tower is back in business and plus, you can have All-Out-Attack once the energy's full.

- 3.0.0 | Coming Soon!

  The Lost Island doesn't exist anymore.

- 6.136.0 | Coming Soon! NEW AVATAR!? EW! 2

  New wizard looks and other new stuff. Making faces for free is no longer available. 
  New unknown outfit: seafoam tank top with fuchsia underwear.

- Prodigy Reborn 1.0 | Not Recommended!

  Too many bugs for the saves in later than April 2020. The saves don't even work in here without the bugs. At least the going home error doesn't occur for any 1-30-0 saves.
